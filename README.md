# A PRACTICE ATTEMPT AT TERMINAL EDITING MARKDOWN FILES 
## My Process 
1. I used the `pico` command to open the terminal editor 
2. I looked at the help guide provided for `pico` 
   * This was accessed by typing `^G`
   * It was easily exited by typing `^X`
3. After the help guide, I looked at the **interface** 
4. I also explored other alternatives for .md file editing 
   * [Dillinger](dillinger.io)
5. I then added the correct text 
6. Laslty, I wrote out the new file 

Hopefully what they say is true: 
> Practice makes perfect!
